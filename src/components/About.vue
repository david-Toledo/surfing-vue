    <p>


    Born and raised in Mexico City in late 90's with a passion for the sea.

  </p>
  <p>
    When I was a kid I used to travel to the beach every year. Even though my family was afraid of the sea I felt in armony with it.
    <p/>

    <p>
    After living and travelling in other cities I arrived to Sydney in 2009 and since then my journey with the surfboards started.
  </p>

    <p>
    In my free time I teach surfing and if you have any query feel free to contact me.
